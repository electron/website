This repository contains the code for the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) website.
It is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

The website currently builds using Node.js 22. If you're using `nvm`, you can set the correct
version of Node.js with `nvm use`.

To get started with a local version of the website, install dependencies with `yarn`. To get the
website running in dev mode, run `yarn start`. To get a production build of the website, run
`yarn build`.

```console
yarn
yarn start
```

## How to modify the documentation

### English docs

For English documentation, the documentation is mirrored from the [electron/electron][] repo.
Changes are picked automatically by the [electron/electron-website-updater][] webhook as soon as they
are made in the latest stable release branch.

For example, if the latest Electron stable release is `v22.0.3`, then any documentation changes in
the `22-x-y` branch in electron/electron will be mirrored into the `main` branch of this repository.

### Translations

This project uses [Crowdin][] to manage localizations. For more information on contributing to
translations, see the [i18n.md][] document.

## How to add a new blog post

To add a new blog post, you need to create a new Markdown file under the `/blog` folder. Supported
frontmatter options are listed in the [Docusaurus Blog docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog#adding-posts).

## Local development

If you want to modify Electron's documentation locally and preview how it looks on the website, you can
tell the `pre-build` script to pull the docs from your local Electron repo.

```console
yarn pre-build ../relative/path/to/local/electron/repo
yarn start
```

## Search indexing

The search functionality on electronjs.org is powered by [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/). DocSearch is a program run by Algolia that offers free
documentation search for open source projects.

If you are a maintainer with an @electronjs.org email, please message [@erickzhao](https://github.com/erickzhao)
to be added to the Algolia project.
