We are excited to announce that Electron has once again been accepted as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025! Google Summer of Code is a global
program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development.

For more details about the program, visit Google’s [Summer of Code homepage](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## About us

Electron is a JavaScript framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using
web technologies. The core Electron framework is a compiled binary executable built with
[Chromium](https://chromium.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and is mostly written in C++.

Outside of the Electron core repository, we also maintain several projects to support the Electron ecosystem, including:

- Tools for end-user distribution (e.g. [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/)
  and [update.electronjs.org](https://github.com/electron/update.electronjs.org)).
- Learning materials for Electron developers (e.g. [electronjs.org](https://electronjs.org)
  and [Electron Fiddle](https://github.com/electron/fiddle)).
- Internal tools to enhance developer productivity (e.g. [Electron Build Tools](https://github.com/electron/build-tools)
  and [Sheriff](https://github.com/electron/sheriff)).

As a GSoC contributor, you will have the opportunity to collaborate with some of Electron’s core contributors
on one of many projects under the [github.com/electron](https://github.com/electron) umbrella.

## Before applying

If you aren’t very familiar with Electron, we would recommend you start by reading the
[documentation](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest) and trying out some of the examples in [Electron Fiddle](https://electronjs.org/fiddle).

To learn more about distributing Electron apps, try creating a sample application with [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/):

```bash
npm init electron-app@latest my-app
```

After familiarizing yourself with the code a bit, come join the conversation on the
[Electron Discord server](https://discord.gg/electronjs).

If this is your first time participating in Google Summer of Code or if you’re new to open source in general,
we recommend reading Google’s [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) before engaging with the community.
