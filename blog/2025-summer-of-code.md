Electron has once again been accepted as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025!
Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development.

For more details about the program, visit Google‚Äôs [Summer of Code homepage](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## About us

Electron is a JavaScript framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using
web technologies. The core Electron framework is a compiled binary executable built with
[Chromium](https://chromium.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and is mostly written in C++.

Outside of the Electron core repository, we also maintain several projects to support the Electron ecosystem, including:

- Tools for end-user distribution (e.g. [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/)
  and [update.electronjs.org](https://github.com/electron/update.electronjs.org)).
- Learning materials for Electron developers (e.g. [electronjs.org](https://electronjs.org)
  and [Electron Fiddle](https://github.com/electron/fiddle)).
- Internal tools to enhance developer productivity (e.g. [Electron Build Tools](https://github.com/electron/build-tools)
  and [Sheriff](https://github.com/electron/sheriff)).

As a GSoC contributor, you will have the opportunity to collaborate with some of Electron‚Äôs core contributors
on one of many projects under the [github.com/electron](https://github.com/electron) umbrella.

## Before applying

If you aren‚Äôt very familiar with Electron, we would recommend you start by reading the
[documentation](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest) and trying out some of the examples in [Electron Fiddle](https://electronjs.org/fiddle).

To learn more about distributing Electron apps, try creating a sample application with [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/):

```bash
npm init electron-app@latest my-app
```

After familiarizing yourself with the code a bit, come join the conversation on the
[Electron Discord server](https://discord.gg/electronjs).

If this is your first time participating in Google Summer of Code or if you‚Äôre new to open source in general,
we recommend reading Google‚Äôs [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) before engaging with the community.

## Project contributions

We encourage you to take a look at any repositories that are relevant to the project ideas you are
interested in. One way of doing your research is to make contributions by reporting bugs, triaging
existing issues, or submitting pull requests. Doing so is an effective way of getting hands-on
practice with our codebases, but is not mandatory for proposal submissions. A well-crafted proposal
should be able to demonstrate your understanding of the code without needing to refer to past
contributions.

Here are a few tips if you are eager to contribute to Electron before submitting your
proposal:

1. Please provide descriptive issue or PR descriptions when submitting contributions. Regardless of
   the code itself, putting effort into the written part of a contribution shows us that you can be an
   effective communicator in a collaborative environment.
1. PRs are always welcome for open issues. You do not need to comment on an issue asking a maintainer
   if you can be assigned to it. Note that we still encourage you to discuss potential solutions on an
   issue if you need to refine an idea for a solution, but comments strictly asking if you can work
   on something are redundant and add noise to the issue tracker.
1. Low-effort project contributions (e.g. invalid issue reports, trivial
   wording changes in a repo README, or minor stylistic changes to front-end code) will
   negatively impact your final proposal, as they take up limited maintainer time and do not provide
   any net benefit to the Electron project.
1. While AI coding assistants can be an effective tool for debugging and understanding new concepts,
   we highly discourage contributions that are copy/pasted directly from AI-generated output. These
   often turn out to be of low quality, and it's often more effort for maintainers to clean up code
   generated from an LLM than for us to just reject a PR altogether.

## Crafting your proposal

Interested in collaborating with Electron? First, check out the
[seven project idea drafts](https://electronhq.notion.site/Electron-Google-Summer-of-Code-2025-Ideas-List-1851459d1bd1811894dad8b48a68596d)
we have prepared. All listed ideas are open for proposals.

If you have a unique idea not on the list, we are open to considering it, but ensure your proposal
is detailed and thoroughly outlined. When in doubt, we recommend sticking with our listed ideas.

Your application should include:

- A detailed proposal outlining what you plan to achieve over the summer.
- Your background as a developer. If you have a resume, please include a copy.
  Otherwise, tell us about your past technical experience.
  - Lack of experience in certain areas won‚Äôt disqualify you, but it will help our mentors work out
    a plan to best support you and make sure your summer project is successful.

[A detailed guide of what to submit as part of your Electron application is here](https://electronhq.notion.site/Electron-Google-Summer-of-Code-2025-Contributor-Guidance-1851459d1bd181ac8004ecb9e031b368). **Submit proposals directly to the Google Summer of Code portal**. Proposals emailed to the Electron team will not be considered as final submissions.

For more guidance on your proposal, we recommend you follow
[the official Google Summer of Code proposal writing advice here](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

Applications open on¬†**March 24th, 2025**¬†and close on¬†**April 8th, 2025**.
