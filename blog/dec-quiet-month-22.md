## What will be the same in December

1. Zero-day and other major security-related releases will be published as necessary. Security incidents should be reported via [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/SECURITY.md).
1. [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) reports and moderation will continue.

## What will be different in December

1. No new Stable releases in December. No Nightly and Alpha releases for the last two weeks of December.
1. With few exceptions, no pull request reviews or merges.
1. No issue tracker updates on any repositories.
1. No Discord debugging help from maintainers.
1. No social media content updates.

## Why is this happening?

With the success of December Quiet Month 2021, we wanted to bring it back for 2022. December continues to be a quiet month for most companies, so we want to give our maintainers a chance to recharge. Everyone is looking forward to 2023, and we expect good things to come! We encourage other projects to consider similar measures.
