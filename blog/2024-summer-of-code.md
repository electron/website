We are excited to announce that Electron has been accepted as a mentoring organization for
the 20th edition of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024! Google Summer of Code is a global
program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development.

For more program details, check out Google’s [Summer of Code homepage](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## About us

Electron is a JavaScript framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using
web technologies. The core Electron framework is a compiled binary executable built with
[Chromium](https://chromium.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and is mostly written in C++.

Outside of Electron core, we also work on a variety of projects to help sustain the
Electron organization, such as:

- End-user distribution tooling (e.g. [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/)
  and [update.electronjs.org](https://github.com/electron/update.electronjs.org)).
- Learning materials for Electron developers (e.g. [electronjs.org](http://electronjs.org)
  and [Electron Fiddle](https://github.com/electron/fiddle)).
- Internal tools to streamline developer productivity (e.g. [Electron Build Tools](https://github.com/electron/build-tools)
  and [Sheriff](https://github.com/electron/sheriff)).

As a Summer of Code contributor, you would be collaborating with some of Electron’s core contributors
on one of many projects under the [github.com/electron](http://github.com/electron) umbrella.

## Before applying

If you aren’t very familiar with Electron, we would recommend you start by reading the
[documentation](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest) and trying out examples in [Electron Fiddle](https://electronjs.org/fiddle).

To learn more about Electron app distribution, you can also play around with
[Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) by creating a sample application:

```bash
npm init electron-app@latest my-app
```

After familiarizing yourself with the code a bit, come join the conversation on the
[Electron Discord server](https://discord.gg/electronjs).

If this is your first time participating in Google Summer of Code or if you’re new to open source in general,
we recommend reading Google’s [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) as a first step
before engaging with the community.

## Drafting your proposal

Interested in collaborating with Electron? First, check out the [seven project idea drafts](https://electronhq.notion.site/Electron-Google-Summer-of-Code-2024-Ideas-List-a1cb01daab3c48a98c30e411e96b218d?pvs=74)
that we have prepared. All of the listed ideas are currently open for proposals.

Have a different idea you’d like us to consider? We’re also open to accepting new ideas that
are not on the proposed project list, but make sure your approach is thoroughly outlined and detailed.
When in doubt, we recommend sticking with our listed ideas.

Your application should include:

- Your proposal: a written document that describes in detail what you plan to achieve over
  the course of the summer.
- Your background as a developer. If you have a resume, please include a copy. Otherwise,
  tell us about your past technical experience.
  - Lack of experience in certain areas won’t disqualify you, but it will help our mentors
    work out a plan to best support you and make sure your summer project is successful.

[A detailed guide of what to submit as part of your Electron application is here.](https://electronhq.notion.site/Electron-GSoC-2024-Contributor-Guidance-f1f4de7a0d9a4664a96c8d4dd70cb208?pvs=4)
Submit proposals directly to the Google Summer of Code portal. Note that proposals emailed to the
Electron team rather than submitted through the application portal will not be considered as a final submission.

If you want more guidance on your proposal or are unsure of what to include, we also recommend that
you follow [the official Google Summer of Code proposal writing advice here](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

Applications open on **March 18th, 2024** and close on **April 2nd, 2024**.

Our 2022 Google Summer of Code intern, [@aryanshridhar](https://github.com/aryanshridhar),
did an amazing job! If you want to see what Aryan worked on during his summer with Electron,
you can read his report in the [2022 GSoC program archives](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2022/organizations/electron).
