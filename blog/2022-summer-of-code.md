The Electron team is excited to announce that we will be participating in Google Summer of Code for the first time this year!

## What is Google Summer of Code?

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a yearly mentoring program connecting open source software projects with potential contributors. Previously open only to students, anyone ages 18 and up can now register for GSoC.

For more information, check out the [Summer of Code homepage](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## How do I sign up?

Are you interested in collaborating with Electron? If you are a new or beginner open source contributor, we welcome you to apply!

In order to be selected as an Electron contributor for Google Summer of Code, you will need to submit an application. Applications will open on **April 4th, 2022** and close on **April 19th, 2022**. [You can follow updates for Google: Summer of Code application guidelines here](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/11/expanding-google-summer-of-code-in-2022.html).

Want to apply? First, check out the [five project idea drafts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJBiju0185Tga99WF3023u0uHgnfCG-J1DfzmhYHca0/edit?usp=sharing) that we have prepared. All of the listed ideas are currently open for proposals. We are also open to accepting new ideas that are not on the proposed project list.

Your application should include:
* Your proposal, which is a written document that describes in detail what you plan to achieve over the course of the summer.
* Your background as a developer. If you have a resume, please include a copy, otherwise tell us about your past experience with an emphasis on relevant technical experience.

[A detailed guide of what to submit as part of your Electron application is here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17vDEvxq7bEwFXO-hJX7bsnyDCx8aRK3yo-rerrxYaOk/edit?usp=sharing)

You can also read through the [official GSoC student/contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) for important tips on preparing your proposal. 

If you want to discuss project proposals or have questions, come hang out in our [#gsoc-general Discord channel](https://discord.gg/w25Dn82xw9)!
